CTA Scraper
==============

[CTA](http://www.transitchicago.com/) provides lots of information on [train and bus status](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/), but it doesn't appear to provide the actual reasons for delays. The [CTA twitter](https://twitter.com/cta) feed does. This is a little project to try and scrape that data and analyze it.
